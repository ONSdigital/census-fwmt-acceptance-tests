Feature: SPG Cancel Tests

  Scenario Outline: As Gateway I can receive a cancel job requests from RM for an existing job
    Given a TM doesnt have a job with case ID "bd6345af-d706-43d3-a13b-8c549e081a76" in TM
    And RM sends a create job request with "<CaseRef>" "<Survey>" "<Type>" "<IsSecure>" "<HandDeliver>"
    And RM sends a cancel case request for the case
    When Gateway receives a cancel message for the case
    Then it will Cancel the job with with the correct TM Action "<TmAction>"
    And the cancel job is acknowledged by TM
   Examples:
      |Survey  | Type    | IsSecure  | CaseRef  | HandDeliver | TmAction |
      | SPG CE | Estab   |  F        | 12345678 | F           | CLOSE    |
