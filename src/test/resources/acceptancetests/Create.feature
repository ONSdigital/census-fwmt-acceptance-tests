Feature: Create Tests

  Scenario Outline: As Gateway I can receive a create job requests from RM
    Given a TM doesnt have a job with case ID "bd6345af-d706-43d3-a13b-8c549e081a76" in TM
    And RM sends a create job request with "<CaseRef>" "<Survey>" "<Type>" "<IsSecure>" "<HandDeliver>"
    When the Gateway sends a Create Job message to TM
    Then a new case is created of the right "<SurveyType>"
    And the right caseRef "<TmCaseRef>"
    And a new case with id of "bd6345af-d706-43d3-a13b-8c549e081a76" is created in TM

  Scenario Outline: As Gateway I can receive a create CE Site job request from RM after a CE Estab has been processed
    Given a TM doesnt have a job with case ID "bd6345af-d706-43d3-a13b-8c549e081a76" in TM
    And RM sends a create job request with "12345678" "CE" "CE Est" "F" "T"
    And RM sends a create CE Site job request with "<CaseRef>" "<Survey>" "<Type>" "<IsSecure>" "<HandDeliver>"
    When the Gateway sends a Create Job message to TM
    Then a new case is created of the right "<SurveyType>"
    And the right caseRef "<TmCaseRef>"
    And a new case with id of "bd6345af-d706-43d3-a13b-8c549e081a76" is created in TM
    Examples:
      | Survey | Type    | IsSecure | CaseRef  | HandDeliver | SurveyType | TmCaseRef      |
      | CE     | CE Site | F        | 12345678 | F           | CE Site    | 12345678       |
      | CE     | CE Site | T        | 12345678 | F           | CE Site    | SECCS_12345678 |
 
  Scenario Outline: As Gateway I can switch a CE survey type that has a matching estabUprn and address type
    Given a TM doesnt have a job with case ID "bd6345af-d706-43d3-a13b-8c549e081a76" in TM
    And RM sends a create job request with "12345678" "CE" "CE Est" "F" "T"
    And RM sends a create CE Unit with the same estabUPRN as the above CE Est request with "<CaseRef>" "<Survey>" "<Type>" "<IsSecure>" "<HandDeliver>"
    Then the existing case is updated to a switch and put back on the queue with caseId "bd6345af-d706-43d3-a13b-8c549e081a76"
    Then the related case will be closed with case ID "bd6345af-d706-43d3-a13b-8c549e081a76"
    And then reopened with the new SurveyType "<SurveyType>" and case ID "bd6345af-d706-43d3-a13b-8c549e081a76"
    Examples:
      | Survey | Type    | IsSecure | HandDeliver | CaseRef  | SurveyType |
      | CE     | CE Unit | F        | T           | 12345678 | CE Site    |
      | CE     | CE Unit | F        | F           | 12345678 | CE Site    |
