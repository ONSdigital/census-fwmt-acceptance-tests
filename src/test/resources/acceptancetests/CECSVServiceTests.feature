Feature: CE CSV service Tests

#  Scenario: As a Gateway I can receive a CSV file for CE and can pass the content to TM
#    Given the Gateway receives a CSV CE with case ID "2f1ea0fd-18b1-4786-b1f7-3e9a79ed1a52"
#    When the Gateway sends a CE Create Job message to TM with case ID "2f1ea0fd-18b1-4786-b1f7-3e9a79ed1a52"
#    And TM picks up the CE Create Job message with case ID "2f1ea0fd-18b1-4786-b1f7-3e9a79ed1a52"
#    Then a new case with id of "2f1ea0fd-18b1-4786-b1f7-3e9a79ed1a52" is created in TM for the CE
