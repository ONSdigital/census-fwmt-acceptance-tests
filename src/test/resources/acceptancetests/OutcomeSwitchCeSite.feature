Feature: Outcome Tests

  Scenario Outline: As a Gateway I can receive an outcome from TM and create Census Events
    Given a parent case exists
    And an "<SurveyType>" "<BusinessFunction>" outcome message
    And its Primary Outcome is "<Primary Outcome>"
    And its secondary Outcome "<Secondary Outcome>"
    And its Outcome code is "<Outcome Code>"
    And the message includes a Linked QID "<HasLinkedQID>"
    And the message includes a Fulfillment Request "<HasFulfilmentRequest>"
    When Gateway receives the outcome
    Then It will run the following processors "<Operation List>"
    And create the following messages to RM "<RmMessages>"
    And the caseId of the "<InitialOperation>" message will be a new caseId
    And every other message will use the new caseId as its caseId
    And each message has the correct values
    And it will create the following messages "<JsMessages>" to JobService

   Examples:
   | SurveyType | BusinessFunction         | Primary Outcome | Secondary Outcome | Outcome Code | HasLinkedQID | HasFulfilmentRequest | Operation List                                                                                 | RmMessages                                                       | InitialOperation      |  JsMessages     |
